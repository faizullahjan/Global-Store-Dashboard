ðŸ”¹ Different Visuals â€“ I worked with bar charts, pie charts, line charts, and maps to analyse sales, profit, and quantity.
 ðŸ”¹ KPIs & Cards â€“ Designed KPI cards to highlight important metrics such as Total Sales and Total Profit.
 ðŸ”¹ Interactive Filters â€“ Added slicers for Country, Region, and Product Name so the report becomes interactive and dynamic.
 ðŸ”¹ Dashboard Design â€“ Experimented with light and dark themes, layouts, and visual sizes to make dashboards more readable and engaging.
 ðŸ”¹ Data Storytelling â€“ Focused on how visuals can quickly communicate business performance over time.
